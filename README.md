## Installation Guide

To get started with the Jupyter notebook, you'll need to install several libraries and tools. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment with the following commands:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**

   You can install all the required libraries using `pip`. Run the following command to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy networkx matplotlib diagrams
   ```

   Note: `diagrams` may require additional setup for custom components.

4. **Install Jupyter Notebook**

   To run the Jupyter notebook, you need to install Jupyter:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

5. **Install Additional Tools**

   Some functionalities in the notebook require additional tools. Install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install subprocess
   ```

6. **Verify Installation**

   You can verify that the installation was successful by running the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will open a Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser where you can navigate to and open the notebook file (`TNVv2.ipynb`).

## Troubleshooting

- **Library Not Found**: If you encounter issues with missing libraries, make sure all dependencies are installed and up-to-date.
- **Permission Issues**: If you have permission issues, try running the installation commands with `sudo` on Unix-based systems or ensure you have the appropriate permissions.
